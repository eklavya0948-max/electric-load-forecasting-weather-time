# Analysis of Electric Load Forecasting using Linear Regression and LSTM

# Project Overview :

This project demonstrates uses of machine learning and deep learning models to predict electrical load using meteorological ( temprature and humidity ) and temporal features ( datetime , weekday , month and season ) 

# Why is electrical load forecasting important ?

In today's world, as we shift to clean resources from traditional fuel-based resources, the use of electricity is increasing in our day-to-day lives. Whether we talk about electric vehicles, data centres, induction stoves, or industrial machinery, everything needs an electrical supply. 

This transition will only succeed if we have a stable, reliable electric grid free from outages. One of the main causes of grid failure is transformer overload when demand spikes unexpectedly.

Electrical load forecasting plays a crucial role in addressing overload issues. It helps operators to predict future load and understand distribution of load throughout the grid maintaining stable electric supply and preventing major grid failures .

# Objectives :

In this project, we are focusing on the implementation and comparison of two models :

Linear Regression ( baseline machine learning model )

LSTM ( Long Short - Term Memory )

Our goal is to evaluate prediction accuracy of electric load using meteorological and temporal data.

# Dataset

The dataset used in this study is from the Ghodshila substation located in Telengana, India. The data was obtained from Mendeley Data, an open research data repository.

Variables in the dataset

The load is calculated from:

Voltage (V)

Current (I)

Power factor (pf)

Additional features:

Active power load (kW)
